# Project Statment :
My project is demonstration of how we can effectively create and deploy a project by using the CI/CD pipelines. In companies the  of development and 
deployments can be very hectic, so by using Devops tools we can automate the tasks. 

# Project Discription :
  This project shows how can developer, by doing changes in his code on Vs Code, the code is automatically  pushed to the Azure Repo and the changes can be 
  visible to deployed website by using the pipelines which are automatically triggers when we commit changes to our code in VScode.
  The project consist of 2 major azure services that are App Services and Azure Devops. In this project I have created a simple static demo website which can further build as per the requirement. The code is stored in the repository which is Azure Repository and the pipelines are created using Azure Devops service.
  The core idea of the project is to address the challenges that can be faced by an organization in delivering software updates and managing the software development lifecycle efficiently. So my project aims to demonstrate the value and importance of Continuous Integration /Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools, particularly using Azure DevOps, to streamline the software development and release process.
  Any organization's current struggles with manual, error-prone deployments, resulting in longer release cycles, increased operational costs, and a higher risk of introducing bugs into production. And various other problems can be solved by using pipelines.
